description: Political Local grabs the latest bills and news from the U.S. congress. It gives users a list of their political representatives and their contact information based on user's location. Users can then use the app to reach their representatives via email, phone, and social media. Contact data for representatives is also stored locally. <a href="https://github.com/joelimyx/Political-Local"><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2c/b6/70/2cb670b6ddd8922a1c1b2fee4f6f758c.jpg" height=100px/></a>
